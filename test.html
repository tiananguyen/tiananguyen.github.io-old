                <h4 class="keydescription">Performing and Competing with De Lynn Dance Company for 14 years, I have found a special place for dance in my heart. Though it wasn't the most exciting activity for me at first, I slowly developed an affinity for this perofmring art and spent more hours every week practicing dance moves in class. After a couple of year, I was given the opportunity to serve as dance team captain. As the team captain, I worked closely with De Lynn Dance team members to help one another perfect dance moves and ultimately get ready for performances and competitions and helped my dance teacher with any tasks needed for shows. I also mentored teen dancers of De Lynn Dance Company to teach new tricks and develop stronger dancers that have a wide range of skill in all dance types.  Additionally, I assisted chaperoning the younger children backstage at performances through making sure everyone was at the correct place at the correct time and checking to see if all makeup and costumes were correct. Through competing, I won several awards such as Overall Dance Champion and 1st Place Solo Acrobatics Routine. Not only did we compete, but we also performed year round at various venues like Christmas in the Park and St. Jude Children's Hospital. Through St. Jude, I worked with these dancers to fundraise money for their cause and led the stretches for a vast amount of runners at St. Jude Children’s Hospital’s Run/Walk to help improvise from the unexpected rain. Below are pictures of a few events we participated in throughout the years. </h4>

                <p class="keydescription">Serving as Leland Key Club's Project Coordinator during my Freshman and Sophomore Year, Division 12 South's Executive Assistant during my Junior Year, and Leland Key Club's President during my Junior and Senior Year, I have had the pleasure to meet so many individuals who, together, made an impact on our community. As President of the largest club on campus for two years, I increased member retention from 120 active members to 180 active members. This was done because of various steps I took throughout my terms. I held weekly Board Meetings to manage Key Club Board and ensure that fundraisers and projects to serve the community were done efficiently. In addition to that, I held weekly General Meetings to further interact with members and update them on Key Club service and social events. As I immensely increased number of members attending events to serve the community from 1-7 members in the previous year to 20-30 members starting from my term as President, I also raised the bar for amount of funds raised for our club and Major Emphasis Projects(Eliminate Project and Pediatric Trauma Program) from $1000 total raised to $5000 total raised. Money was raised through organizing Charity Dinners and Socials. Overall, the Key Club experience made me a stronger leader that I had never thought I would be. You can read more about some of the things I did in Key Club in my 2017 Distringuished President Application Portfolio below! </p>
