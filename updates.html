        <div class="update1-inner">
            <p> As the Caltrain approached the Santa Clara departure stop, I gathered my belongings and got ready to go. I got up and said bye to the Engage Scholars that I always sat next to on the ride home, and they responded with "Bye Tiana. I'll see you around." And that's when it hit me. That's when I knew that my time at the Pinterest Engage Scholars program has ended. I had never thought that just six sessions could change my perspective on things so much, but it truly did leave a big impact in my daily life. Here are a few things that I learned: </p>
            <p> Culture. Something that I've completely failed realized is so important is having good culture. I think I have been lucky to have been able to imerse myself into good culture and surround myself around good people in general. I've never really been in a situation in which I didn't like the environment. However, at Pinterest, as we were learning about some of the typical things one should usually look for in a company, one of the points in good culture. And after the six sessions, I observed that Pinterest definitely matches my criteria for what good culture should be like. As one of the Pinployees led a session, there were so many people he said hi to as they walked by that had a close connection to him. Everyone just seemed to know one another. Futuremore, the building itself is decorated so nicely and gave off a more homey feel, which was nice. However, the importance of culture doesn't just stop at companies. Good culture should be everywhere, and I will always want to imerse myself in it as I move on in life. </p>
            <p> Connection. This is something that I've always known was important, but I learned an even greater importance of it throughout the program. At Pinterest, I got the opportunity to meet so many smart individuals in general who I could really learn a lot of new and cool things from. To come together because we all share the same passions, and to dive more into these passions as well as explore different passions that each other have is something that will always be so precious to me. </p>
            <p> A New Perspective. Before, I've never really had a motto. I always just lived my life and had periods in which I would often say certain phrases, but it wasn't something I would live by at every single moment. However, Pinterest's collaborating and creative culture inspired me to come up with a perspective that would fit well with the company and my way of life. And although this new perspective that I learned isn't something I would live by 24/7, it's something that I've began to integrate into my day to day life. This new perspective is to do cool things with good people. I love this because it can be applied to just about anything. From a simple activity like baking new sweets with kind and caring individuals, to something more complicated like working on a coding project to make a positive impact on the community with collaborative and nice individuals, this motto can cover any situation.  </p>
            <p> Overall, the Pinterest Engage Scholars program was such an amazing program, and I would love to do it all over again if I could. There are truly no amount of “thank you”s that could ever express the infinite amount of gratitude I have towards every Pinployee, Pintern, and fellow Engage Scholar. </p>

            <p> What does one do at this new freshman/sophomore program hosted by Pinterest for technology enthusiasts and computer science majors? Since this was the first year Pinterest was hosting such a program, I was unsure of the answer to this question myself. After many attempts to find more information about the program, I decided to try something new and take on this opportunity. This is the blurb that they gave us after attending my first session : "As an Engage Scholar, I participated in a series of interactive sessions focused on technical and professional development for freshman and sophomore computer science majors. Sessions focused on providing Scholars with the skills to land, prepare for, and excel in Software Engineering positions, while preparing Scholars for future career growth and development." But is the program what they made it out to be like? </p>
            <p> Just after attending one session, I can say no. Why? Because it's so much more than just a program for "future career growth and development." That was a little cliche, but let me explain why this Engage Program has already had an effect on me. When first applying for this program, one of the requirements was to include a link to our own Pinterest account. Not having used Pinterest in about 3 years, I almost completely stopped applying overall, for I thought I had no chance at this point. Because Pinterest had never been a social media platform that I found particularly engaging, I hadn't taken a look at my account in a while. But for the first time in 3 years, I finally managed to log into my account after several attempts(because I forgot my password) and explored Pinterest. Soon enough, I realized that I had spent two hours enjoying myself while I scrolled through pins, created new boards, and saved pins to boards. Now, I was hyped up and super excited to compete for a spot in this program. Because there wasn't a lot of information about this program, as I mentioned before, I came into my first session unsure of what I was getting myself into. However, I'm glad I was able to get selected for this opportunity. I was not only able to learn how to improve myself professionally in terms of networking online and in person, but I was also able to meet amazing individuals who were well accomplished and fun to be around. Of course, I felt intimidated since many of my fellow 20 scholars attend top universities and have many activities on their plates, but that's just what helps challenge and push me forward. I'm looking forward to seeing who and where I'll be by the end of this program. </p>
            <p> And as a side note, with everything that Pinterest had given to me so far, I came to the conclusion that should take my involvement with Pinterest to another level through working with the Pinterest developer API to create an application that would perform an efficient action for users' Pinterests would be something fun. Wherever this ends up taking me, I hope to learn more along the process and expand my programming  as well as personal skills. For now, feel free to take a look at my Pinterest below! </p>

                    <p> There he goes. Far, far away from where he's always been all of his life, for the next two years. From being a whale, to a bronco, to a charger, to back to a bronco, and now to a tartan, he's in for an adventure and I can't wait to see where this journey will lead him. </p>
                    <p>It’s sad to admit that at this point, I’m no longer sad that my brother, Thomas, is going off to Carnegie Mellon for his Masters in Computer Engineering. Just a few weeks ago, I was definitely more devastated at this fact, because it’s been a fun time going to school and living with him for the past 18 years. Especially once we both began attending Santa Clara University, I felt like our bond grew stronger. So as it started to actually hit me that these fun moments of seeing each other everyday, being on the same board(ACM), planning hackathons and tech workshops, buying lunch for him with my extra meal points, hanging out with each other’s friends, and so much more, will be disappearing next year, I realized how much of an impact Thomas made in my life. More importantly than the fun moments we shared that made transitioning into college a lot easier, he taught me important life lessons through the small as well as meaningful conversations we would have every now and then. I can’t thank him enough for everything he has done, and is still doing for me. It feels great to have an older brother like him and I hope I never take him for granted. Times at Santa Clara won’t be the same without him, but it will be exciting to see where we both end up after our journey through school. Have fun and good luck, Thomas! </p>

            <p> It’s Week 10 and I’m just about ready to go. Except not really. While I’m here sitting on the third floor of the library(my new home), watching people pass by, and writing this entry, I’m reflecting upon everything that has happened these past three quarters and wondering where the heck has time gone. I honestly can’t completely recount what even happened last weekend, so remembering everything that has happened in the past year may be a struggle, but here we go!</p>
            <p> Fall Quarter was all about the new. From new friends, to new living environment, and to new habits, I became more cultured from the various individuals I’ve met and gained an experience that was so pure and precious. What was important to me in the moment was that I get settled in and be comfortable with my living environment and individuals in this space. This mainly simply included my roommates and friends made inside McLaughlin-Walsh Residence Hall. As I grew a closer bond with these friends, we went out together and explored what the CalTrain could offer rides to and the Santa Clara University campus itself. If I had to choose my favorite moment from this quarter, it would definitely be the first week of SCU because that was when I felt the most vulnerable, yet the most free. Fall Quarter is about trying the new things and expanding horizons. </p>
            <p> Winter Quarter was about exploring past my comfort zone. Now that I had experienced one quarter of Santa Clara University, I was more comfortable with the environment and was ready to go beyond what I was comfortable with. One big thing that this meant was meeting new people outside of my dorm community. As a result, forming connections with upperclassmen I met in clubs and organizations was what happened the majority of Winter Quarter. But aside from making new friends, I got highly involved with SCU’s Association for Computing Machinery. Through being Underclassmen Representative for this organization, I helped with workshops and hackathon planning, which became my highlights of my quarter. Though vibes already didn’t feel the same as first quarter and the weather was dark and gloomy, I still appreciated everything that happened during this quarter. </p>
            <p> Spring Quarter was all about digging deeper. This was without a doubt my favorite quarter. After meeting multiple individuals, being involved in organizations, and getting used to Santa Clara University in general, I began to further develop both relationships and involvement in things at SCU. Though I didn’t join anything new or meet as many people compared to the previous two quarters, I was able to put focus on what I had going in the moment and pour all my effort into my involvement so far. This is why Spring Quarter is my favorite color. There’s a level of comfort that I had at SCU that still made me feel vulnerable- since I was trying new things— but also comfortable— since I was simple exploring what I was comfortable with. Spring Quarter was a combination of Fall Quarter and Winter Quarter and it made for a good mix that I will never forget. A favorite memory of Spring Quarter you may wonder? It was definitely the countless amount of times I would listen to the song “Gravity” by Timeflies. One line that my friends could always count me on singing would be “Is it gravity or are we falling in …” </p>
            <p> I’m super excited for what’s to come this upcoming year, and especially excited to meet my new fellow broncos as well as take interesting classes— more than just the general education. Next year will be so go broncos. </p>

            <p>April 9, 2018</p>
            <hr>
            <div class="update1-inner">
                <p> Recently I’ve been hit by a sudden shock and turn of events. But that’s a story I’ll have to talk about next time. Instead, let me share you what I have learned from the experience so far. </p>
                <p>By the way I see it, if you want to get something done, there are two ways to make this happen. The first one is the most popular option : motivating yourself. Motivation, as defined by the Oxford Dictionary, is the reason or reasons for acting or behaving in a particular way. The second one is one that I’ve neglected for a while : discipling yourself. Discipline, as defined by the Oxford Dictionary is the practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behaviour, using punishment to correct disobedience. Although both of these terms seem to almost be the same, there is one big difference that I found about the two. That is, motivation relies on your mood. If for some reason, one day you don’t feel happy, there is a higher chance of you not being productive because you’ve become dependent on motivation to get you through work. In contrast, if you begin to discipline yourself to work, you’ll always be able to work no matter how you’re feeling that day. To put all of this in simpler terms, if you were an olympian, you wouldn’t want to wait until you’re in olympic form to start training. </p>

                    <p>Error 404. Page Not Found. We’ve all seen this before. Whether it’s because out internet isn’t working at the moment, or it’s because the webmaster did something wrong and it fixing it at the moment, there are so many possibilities of why this page pops up on our screen. One of the biggest causes behind this error page is due to cybercrimes. As more individuals and items connect to the internet, there has been more cybercrimes and hacks occurring that need to be taken care of with the help of cybersecurity. Ultimately, we need to make sure technology is being used for good and not being misused for harm. In the films I,Robot and Minority Report, it is clearly demonstrated that cybersecurity is necessary, for individuals in the films take advantage and hack into the software and hardware of artificial intelligence and system. Success of companies now rely on the digital economy, which has led to cybersecurity becoming more and more important as social obligation to ensure security is forefronting our minds when we go about our day to day lives. This ultimately leads to the question : How can we make cybersecurity better and more effective </p>
                    <p>To start off, let’s dive more into how cybersecurity even came about. As scientific discovery grew, scientists needed better developed technology to store their data and share it with others. In order for scientists to share this information with one another, computer networking was created. This was system in which multiple computers(each computer referred to as a node) are connected to each other to share resources from one computer to another. As this system developed, it soon transformed into the World Wide Web, which permitted individuals to quickly and efficiently share information with one another from around the world. In 1985, the global Internet increased in Europe and the invention of the Domain Name System(DNS) came about. The Domain Name System has become an essential component to the World Wide Web and Internet in general, for it assigns domain names to Internet resources. This ultimately made connecting things to the internet easier, which resulted in the numerous Internet of Things(IoT) today. Because we are now able to connect so many things to the internet, there are many benefits to doing so, such as having access to others’ locations in case they are in danger and creating success for companies, since they rely on digital economy. However, there are numerous disadvantages that we need to take care of as we connect more items to the internet. This is where cybersecurity kicks in. In the past— and present — individuals are using the World Wide Web to scam other people through the Domain Naming System with countries like China tracking popular domains until they scam individuals. However, this is only one of the same instances in which technology creates harm and we are in need of cybersecurity. With more efficient cybersecurity, we’ll be able to keep computer systems running smoothly and prevent attacks, since cybersecurity is essentially a group of technologies and processes designed to protect networks and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. </p>
                    <p>In recent years, cities are becoming smarter and smarter and communities around the  world, from small towns to big metropolitan areas, are turning to modern technologies to connect government agencies and citizens to deal with urban problems such as traffic congestion, public service shortcomings, and energy shortages. Because smart cities rely on wireless and mobile technologies, a smart city ecosystem is a widely interconnected network, much bigger than any regular system of a private organization such as a business. With such interconnection and availability, it is hard to know what is exposed and the level of exposure. Attackers have many potential ways to interfere with the services. Zhen Li and Qi Liao further explore this danger, in their article “Economic Solutions to Improve Cybersecurity of governments and smart cities via vulnerability markets.” After concluding that any technological products would be securer if they are produced with higher level of security, or found vulnerabilities are patched by vendors before the information is exploited by attackers, Li and Liao proposed two alternative economic solutions the government may use to address the cybersecurity challenges facing smart cities and e-government. The first one was the creation of incentive systems for vendors to invest in security. Through this process, it would hopefully further motivate vendors to get cybersecurity so that they can get government company benefits. The second proposal they developed was a vulnerability market for defensive buyers to acquire vulnerabilities to prevent the vulnerability information from falling into the wrong hands.</p>
                    <p>As the success of companies rely on digital economy, companies have been collecting an abundant amount of data from individuals about their personal information. While individuals should have the right to know what data is being collected from them and what happens after the collection, this is not the case. Even when there is a cybercrime and companies are in a data breach, there is a lot of hesitation that comes about about multiple things. The first topic of discussion is the amount of disclosure the company should inform the public. Because companies sometimes don’t understand what exactly went on in the breach, there is an uncertainty about when to disclose information and how long to withhold it. However, companies have to also take into consideration how individuals being attacked will feel, for the company should be transparent to the world in order to gain trust, but they don’t want everyone to always know every single thing that has happened at the same time. This leads to the next ethical issue of trust. Building trust between the company and customer is extremely important, which requires two roles for the company : roles as a security and role as a trust. Since there is a grey area of performing harm assessment that doesn’t only meet the minimum requirement, companies must foster a greater trust in their brand and be transparent at a moderate amount. This leads to one of the hardest ethical issues : the potential of hard to come from the release of information. It’s important to have a commitment to transparency, for companies have responsibility to holder of the data to do the right thing. Companies need to put themselves in position of the victim and go about the best way as to how the victim will receive information of an event that occurred.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, cybersecurity is an essential commodity of the future that will not only protect individuals from getting their personal information stolen, but will also further the economy. However, to get to a good cybersecurity system, we must start from the ourselves, and from there we will be able to spread and reach towards others. Since the concept of cybersecurity is often not easy to explain, for it concerns both humans and systems, we must know what cybersecurity truly is ourselves and acknowledge that cybersecurity is a problem we shouldn’t look over. Without understanding this part, there would be a lack of sense of urgency in many individuals which results in no action towards a better cybersecurity system. From here, we can go to companies— or if ambitious enough, make a company ourselves— of how important cybersecurity is to our lives. There needs to be some kinds of social obligation in the future to ensure security is forefronting our minds when we go about our day to day lives.</p>

                <p>Recently I came across the question of why pigeons move their heads back and forth while they walk and discovered that pigeons do so in order stabilize their vision and gain depth perception. Interestingly enough, after further reading, I found out that pigeons actually don't bob their heads back and forth, but rather they move their heads forward and then keep it still until their body catches up. What an illusion.</p>
                <p>As I ended my first quarter of Santa Clara University, I realized how much I didn't know. Although, I'm thankful that I've met so many individuals whom have already taught me so much about their own cultures and other common information about life in general, there is always an itch in the back of my mind reminding me that I can always learn more. Even simply coming across the question regarding the movement of pigeons is something interesting to add to my knowledge. Through learning more things everyday — whether or not it is useful information — I not only add to my knowledge, but can also further add to conversations and teach other individuals. That's why, as I move forward to the next year, I plan to embark on a new journey : Project Explore. And no, this isn't about exploring the area, but about exploring the mind. It's about exploring the information that I never knew before. It's about thinking beyond what I am asked. It's about asking questions and challenging ideas. It's about exploring what I don't and do know to further understand other individuals and the world. I'm ready to move forward.</p>

                <p>From the first phone call through a vertical metal cone in 1876, to the cutting edge smartphones of 2017 that can detect your face to unlock it, technology has immensely changed throughout the years. It is that change—that innovation and ability to evolve— that makes technology so amazing.  Everyday, individuals are working to create new advancements that will help our community and society as a whole. Due to the constant change in technology, we are now able to do things instantaneously and easily. However, as insignificant as the first computer may seem in comparison to the lightweight laptops individuals own today, every new invention and creation has made a tremendous impact in our lives. I had no clue how harmful the internet could be to our lives until I attended various cybersecurity talks last month at Santa Clara University due to the fact that it was cyber security month. It became clear that everyone should be knowledgable about these harmful things in life in order for individuals to be mindful of everything they do. But before I dive into the harm, I'll quickly outline the background of the internet. </p>
                <p>As computer networking further developed and grew, British Scientist, Tim Berners-Lee, quickly realized that he can develop an internet application built on the physical capabilities of computer networking. In 1989, Berners-Lee took his vision of a global hyperlinked information system and brought it to life through the inventions of the World Wide Web(WWW), which permitted individuals to quickly and efficiently share information with one another from around the world. However, Berners-Lee has to take a series of steps before he could get to this point. In 1985, the global Internet increased in Europe and the invention of the Domain Name System(DNS) came about. The Domain Name System has become an essential component to the World Wide Web and Internet in general, for it assigns domain names to Internet resources. Another important aspect to the Internet was also built upon the Domain Name System, called the Uniform Resource Locator(URL), which specified the location of a web resource on a computer network and the device retrieving it. From here, Berners-Lee’s vision for hypertext links to include multimedia documents was born. Instead of having screens filled with texts of one font and one size, Berners-Lee used his development of Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) and his development of the language Hypertext Markup Language(HTML) to make the Graphic User Interface more appealing to look at and added media to his project. The first website in the world was finally developed and hosted on Berners-Lee’s NeXT computer, as shown in the image to the left. Through this first website, Berners-Lee explained the basic features of the web and gave instructions on how to access other individuals’ information, to further help scientists around the world. However, as this phenomenon spread around the world, it became popular and on demand among everyone across the globe. As a result, on April 30, 1993, CERN put the World Wide Web software in a public domain and ultimately declared that this World Wide Web technology would be freely accessible by anyone. From there, the technology began to be widely used, which greatly helped everyone worldwide.</p>
                <p>Although computer networking and the World Wide Web are helpful to everyone across the globe, it has caused harm and issues for our society. While the Internet of Things(the concept of connecting a device with an on/off switch to the internet) grew, more and more cyber crimes have come about, for people use the World Wide Web to scam others. Unfortunately, we can find harm anywhere— even in children play toys. As trivial as a child’s toy may seem, if it is connected smart, interactive, and internet-connected, the whole family could be unsafe. Since these toys contain sensors, microphones, cameras, and other multimedia capabilities, the interactions or conversations between the toy and the child has to be collected somewhere. While they are often sent and stored by the manufacturer or developer through cloud service, some third party companies managing the voice recognition software used in the toys collect information instead. This leaves voice recordings, home addresses, and other personal data vulnerable and exposed if the security of the data is not sufficiently protected. Even when one may think that one are too far away for the toy to detect one’s voice, it is possible for toys with microphones to record and collect conversations within earshot of the object. This easily leaks any information about the child’s name, school, and activities to the public and could potentially use this for identity fraud. Connection to the internet also offers criminals a way to misuse sensitive data, like GPS location information. </p>
                <p>Ultimately, anything that can be connected to the internet, will be connected. Eventually, the use of internet will dominate our world, which will not only impact how we work, but how we live as well. As a result, it’s important and imperative that we pay careful attention to what we do with our access to the internet. Not only will this extra caution of our actions help us be protected in the long term, but it will help our society as a whole. </p>

                <p>The start of my first year at Santa Clara University means the start of something new! I wanted to make something that I could look back upon at the end of the year and think, "Wow life at SCU was really fun." The first idea that came to my mind was to keep a journal. However, I knew that I would get caught up in school that I may not have been able to write much every day or just not write at all. As a result, I decided to make a Bullet Journal. For those of you who may not know, a Bullet Journal is a journal that consists of to-do lists, personal entries, event trackers, and much more. Once I got this idea, I decided to get started with the September portion right away.</p>
                <p>"Look at the sky," my friend once told me. For a while I was confused, for I didn't see anything in the sky; it was just blue. But I finally figured it out and responded, "Because the sky is limitless." It turns out that there was no right answer, but I had been the first person with a positive response. This moment ran through my head as I was trying to pick the Bullet Journal September theme and as a result, I decided to have a sky theme because the first year will be limitless. Filling the pages with decorative clouds, suns, and paper airplanes, I was so exscited for it to finally be September so that I could fill this journal out. Aside from the decorative drawings, I decided to also add a calendar to add events to, a habit tracker to track how many times I do certain positive habits, a sleep tracker to log the hours I sleep every day, a class schedule to remind myself of my first quarter, a daily to-do list to remind myself of what I have to do every day, and an all things new list to log all of the new things I do and see at SCU. Ultimately through this Bullet Journal, I hope to encourage myself to do better things every day and look back at the year thinking it was the best year yet.</p>

                <p>iD Tech was definitely an amazing experience and I'm so glad I got to end my iD Tech experience at Stanford University iD Tech Alexa. At this camp, all of the students were girls and many of them stayed overnight at Stanford with the instructors. In addition to that, the set up at Alexa was definitely different from iD Tech Camps as well. This made teaching the students a completely different experience that added a lot of variety. Another difference was that after hours of teaching, we ended our instructional time with a group chat about certain questions we prepared for them to help the students think more about what inspires them. By the end of the week, I made sure that the students' final project helped solve a social issue that was important to them. After instructional time, we prepared activities for the overnight campers to keep them entertained, such as a Scavenger Hunt and Movie Night. This was the time in which I could learn a lot from the students. From learning how to make friendship bracelets for the first time, to being informed about current celebrity gossip, I definitely enjoyed my time with them throughout the entire week. I even got the opportunity to wake the students up at 6:50AM almost every morning. I was so excited to do this that I made sure I knocked on their dorm doors right on time and even have a small conversation with each of them.</p>
                <p>Though iD Tech Camp at West Valley College was not an overnight experience, I still had a fun time teaching the students and, once again, learning a lot from them. During our breaks away from the computers, the students taught me things like magic tricks with cards -that I now try to show my friends- and various video games like narwhale.io. By the end of the session at West Valley College, it was time to pack everything up and say our final goodbyes. It was a long process that was bittersweet. As much as I wanted to go home and sleep after the tiring day, I wanted to stay because it couldn't hit me that this may be the last time I see some of my co-workers again. After we finished packing up, we gathered for one final staff raffle and a group hug. </p>
                <p>Aside from the students, my co-workers were also amazing people and I got to learn a lot from the workers from both West Valley College  iD Tech Camp and Stanford university iD Tech Alexa. At both locations, all of my co-workers had already finished at least a year in college, which made the experience very intereseting. As some of them taught me different things that happen in college and what to stay away from, others simply taught me random facts that they learned in college. By the end of every day, I would have a new perspective on at least one thing. I'm glad I got to come out of iD Tech with more knowledge than I had before. It was definitely an experience I will never forget.</p>

                  <p>The moment my alarm clock goes off, I can only think, “Not again.” I begin slicking my hair back into a ponytail, while frantically looking through my closet for a leotard. I’m running out of time. “Let’s go,” I shout. This has been my Saturday routine since I was four years old.</p>
                  <p>Never had I ever thought that a performing art would create a big impact on my life and allow me to learn life lessons that I would hold onto forever. Through dance, I’ve been given the wonderful opportunity to meet so many people with different backgrounds and perspectives on life. When I walk into dance class, I enter a new world, surrounded by people with different backgrounds. To my right, I find a girl struggling with anxiety while to my left, I find a boy living the ideal life. From Big Tiana screaming at Alyssa to say “grandma” in Vietnamese, to the current team wanting to play SAT games on my phone, I have definitely met a diverse group of individuals. However, regardless of the differences each dancer holds, we gather for one motive : to perform our passion. We learn from each other’s strengths and weaknesses so that we can congruously move to the rhythm together. But I couldn’t have gotten to this point or be who I am without the special individual who has taught me so many things over the years.</p>
                 <p> Not only did I learn a variety of tricks, jumps, and turns, but I also learned important life lessons that I now hold and integrate into my way of life. It’s amazing how much the things you do and say have rubbed off on me because I definitely do tell my students that “not everyone is a winner” at iD Tech. I definitely did tell my Key Club Board that just because we got all the awards in the Division doesn’t mean we’re good, it just means that “everyone else is a lot worse.” And of course, I definitely do listen to Ed Sheeran all of time in the car. Your lessons have a big impact on my life and I couldn’t be where I am or who I am without you. I can’t believe that after 14 years I am finally going off to college and sadly writing this letter. But it’s good to know that even if I never step into this dance journey again, the values and lessons learned will forever stay with me. Luckily, I'll be staying close for college, so I can come back and visit any time. See you soon, De Lynn Dance Company.</p>

                <p>Santa Clara University's Orientation was not what I thought it would be. The moment I stepped out of my car, there was already a welcoming Orientation Leader dancing around, ready to lead me to the Residence Halls. "FULL SEND. IT'S A FULL SEND," echoed throughout the school. After I checked into my room, I observed my surroundings, because I was clueless of what to do next. A lot of individuals were on their phone- whether they were actually  using it or just to pass by awkward time. Instead of using my phone, I decided to start a conversation with some people. Everyone that I met throughout the day at every Oreintation Session I attended were all kind and welcoming. From talking about the college life, to talking about our favorite Disney movie, I had a wide variety of conversations with many people. </p>
                <p>At the end of the day, we had a big social that the Orientation Leaders made a big deal out of. They all were running up and down with microphones and were dressed up in safari themed outfits. As they screamed Bronco Chants and led us to the social room, everyone around me was excited and ready to have some fun for the night. Once we all got to the room, they taught us the SCU Cheer and performed a long and intricate dance for us. This was probably the most awkward part for my at Orientation becuase I'm an extremely awkward dancer. So instead of dancing the night, I went back to the residance halls to play board games and watch movies withmy peers.The next morning, I finally got to choose my classes and plan the rest of the year with a counselour. Though it was a little stressing, I really liked looking at the great variety of classes and freedom to choose whichever one I wanted. We finally ended Orientation inside the theater and met up with our RLC group to do our final group "Unity" cheer. I really enjoyed having this session as the closing welcoming session to SCU. </p>
                <p>Thank you for making it an amazing two days for me. It was definitely a great experience that showed me that this school will always be there for me when I need it with amazing individuals who will help guide me to great education and future as well as individuals who know how to make me smile. I can't wait to "full send it" at Santa Clara University in September.</p>

        <div class="update1-inner">
            <p>Less than a month later and I'm already back at it again with Key Club. After being asked by the Division 12 South Lieutenant Governor to host two workshops(the "Presidents Workshop" "and the "BEEing a Leader Workshop") at Key Club Training Conference, I couldn't just let this opportunity go. I wanted to make sure that the future leaders of Key Club would be trained and ready to leave a legacy. I was truly excited to share my love for Key Club and Key Club knowledge to all the future and current leaders.</p>
            <p>In the midst of teaching at iD Tech, I was preparing to lead workshops with my partners: the President of Silver Creek Key Club and the Division 34 South Lieutenant Governor. I wasn't really sure what to expect, since this would be my first time at Key CLub Training Conference, but my partners were cooperative and on top of their game. By the time Key Club Training Conference came, there were so many familiar faces that I got to reunite and catch up with. Not only did I get to catch up with the Key Clubbers, but I also got to talk to all of the amazing advisors and Kiwanians who made this event happen again. In between each Round Robbin Workshop for BEEing a Leader, I got to ask Key Clubbers questions about Key Club to test their knowledge and get to know them. Although some did not know the answer, they were all determined to try again with a different question. However, many of them were spot on with their answers, which made the event so great and fun. </p>
            <p>Though attending Key Club Training Conference was a wonderful experience, it honestly felt a little odd coming back into the club and attending a Region event in the Summer. I felt as if I didn't belong there anymore- as if my time in Key Club was over. Although, yes it's true, my time in Key Club is over, I couldn't help but letting that get to me and reminding myself about that throughout the entire event. In fact, one of my very own club members asked me if I was here to chaperone for them. That is when it hit me that I needed to stop living in the past and look towards the future. Yes, I'll still visit Leland Key Club occassionally to check up on them and reunite with people I've formed a great relationship with through this club, but I'll always remember that it's about the new leaders of Key Club leaving a legacy. So thank you again Key Club for everything. See you soon. </p>

                <p>I had aboslutely no clue what the iD Tech Life would be like, but I'm so glad I am being a part of it. Prior to working with iD Tech, I was having a conversation with my friend's mom about tech companies and iD Tech popped up into our conversation. "I was going to send my son to iD Tech, but then I read a bad review, so I decided to not send him to that camp anymore," she mentioned. Now, I never told her that I had applied to work there, and after she made her comments about iD Tech, I was scared to tell her. After I got a job offer from them and accepted it, I made it my duty to give the kids a fun, safe, and great learning experience that would bring them back next summer. I imdediately started making worksheets for my courses and planning out daily agendas. I couldn't be a disappointment. </p>

                <p>Just yesterday, I finished off my first week of working with iD Tech, and boy was it scary yet exciting. This first course that I had to teach was called Coding 101. In this course, I taught the students JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. While I love working with children, it was definitely difficult to get them to pay close attention and fully understand what is happening behind their code. At the end of every day, they always had more questions, making me stay up late to create worksheets filled with answers and practice exercises so that they could further understand the program. Teaching the kids was a little tough, but I was so happy that by the end of the week, they had made a clean and aesthetic website filled with many interactive features and skills I taught them. </p>
                <p>Teaching wasn't all of what I had to keep in mind during camp. I had to make sure that everyone was having fun, yet being safe at the same time. From planning spirit days for the campers to enjoy, to planning fun activiites for the kids to play during the breaks off the computers, I tried my best to make their camp experience special. This being my first week working at iD Tech and West Valley's first iD Tech Camp ever, I was determined to ensure that it went smoothly. </p>
                <p>There is no doubt that there were some obstacles we all had to tackle throughout the week, it only made me stronger. Through this first week, I've not only gained skills in teaching and handling kids, but also learned new iDeas and perspectives from my coworkers. I'm excited to spend the rest of my summer working with iD Tech and gaining new iDeas. </p>

            <h1>Goodbye Leland High School</h1>
            <p>June 8, 2017</p>
            <hr>
            <div class="update1-inner">
                <div class="column">
                    <p>I'm the kind of person who doesn't mind a lot of things and just goes with the flow. When I'm asked to make a decision, I tend to say, "Anything you want is fine by me," until they force me to pick something. This is both a good and a bad trait that I've noticed as many things end and I have to say goodbye. Don't get me wrong, I do have some emotion when things are ending, but not enough for me to completely throw my life away and think about it for a long time. Today was graduation. I've never had such a bad high school experience to the point in which I want to leave so badly, but at the same time I don't mind leaving and starting something new. On the the other hand, I haven't had such an amazing high school experience to the point in which I want to stay so badly, but at the same time I wouldn't mind spending another year at Leland.</p>
                    <p> Though I do have my weird trait, I still thought that graduation would be emotional and the fact that I'm leaving would really hit me as I walked across the stage. However, while many of my other friends were crying and hugging one another and taking pictures while saying their final goodbyes, I realized that I was not emotional at all. In fact, I don't think I really felt anything, besides my stomach growling for food and a rush to finish taking pictures with everyone who came to support me. Even after I finsihed taking pictures with my relatives and close friends, I just stood there - looking around to see what I should do next. My brother suggested that I walk around and see if I wanted to take pictures with anyone else, so I did. After half a round of the Rose Garden, I had only found one other person to take a picture with, but I was satisfied. My brother asked me again to walk around because it was the last time I would ever see many of these individuals again, but I resisted. What really mattered was that I got pictures with the people who were close to me and impacted my high school career greatly. And that was enough. Thank you to everyone who I encountered throuhgout my journey through high school. And goodbye Leland High School.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The end of Key Club means the end of many things. It means the end of my Key Club duties. It means the end of Division Council Meetings. It means the end of volunteering with the most passionate people at Leland High School. But it also means the end of the Instagram highonkey account that I made with my secretary and best friend, Jessica. After a meeting in January, we realized that our Key Club Journey was ending soon. As a result, we decided to be a little extra and make an account that would document something Key Club related that we did everyday until today- the end. Before I talk about the account, I'll share my Key Club Journey with you to show you why I would even love a club so much to do this.</p>
                <p>It's a little embarrassing to say that my Key Club Journey started off with my brother forcing me to join Key Club when he was President and I was a freshman. Being a shy and timid person, I forced the rest of my friends along with me so that I would have someone to be with in the club. Now it’s even more embarrassing to say I never had a real passion for Key Club until about four months after I became Project Coordinator my Freshman Year. I had always thought that I really liked Key Club until that time, but later on I realized that it was a fake love formed just because my brother was passionate about it. In my mind, I imagined that the more work I did for Key Club, the more passionate I would be. As a result, I always tried to coordinate the most events in one month and do as much extra work as I could possibly do. The new passion formed four months after wasn’t developed until I realized that it’s better to find quality service projects that more members would be excited to come to and focus on tackling a specific aspect to improve Key Club before moving on to the next problem. As time went on, I continued to take these baby steps until I could finally take risks in the different ways I ran things. And finally by the end of my Sophomore year, I got the courage to pursue the position of President of Leland Key Club. </p>
                <p>From then on, it became a long, windy, up and down roller coaster that I never wanted to end. But here we are. There is no doubt that there were plenty of mistakes made throughout my Key CLub Journey, but if I had the opportunity to change something, I wouldn’t change a thing because every ounce of effort and action that occurred led up to this year, to now, to the end of an amazing ride I could never forget. Seeing so many members constantly signing up for events and attending fundraisers and socials made me feel proud to be part of Leland Key Club. I have been given the wonderful opportunity to meet many spectacular individuals who not only exemplify the Key Club core values, but integrate them into their way of life as well. It’s the best feeling when a Key Clubbers comes up to you and tells you how fun an event was because then, you know that you are doing your job right. Though Key Club is full of wonderful individuals, not everything is perfect. With every problem and conflict came a rewarding lesson to learn from the experience. I have definitely grown as an individual, learning the biggest lessons in my high school career through Key Club. So, thank you Key Club for expanding my horizons and shaping me into a better leader and person. Thank you key Club for making me realize that the most popular decision may not always be the right decision. Thank you key club for showing me that it’s okay to be my weird self without caring what everyone has to think of me. But most importantly, thank you Key Club for giving me a second family I can share my life stories with and depend upon when I’m down. </p>
                <p>So there you have it, a quick summary of why I enjoy this club so much. However, highonkey wasn't made just for us, it was made for everyone. We wanted to rub our passion for Key Club off on others who were following our account and remind them everyday of why Key Club is so special. We especially hope to see more highonkey accounts in the future because it's such a wonderful organization. It’s amazing how so many people join Key Club for the college applications, scholarships, or maybe because they were forced into it like I was, but they all stay for the same reason : to become part of a family they can never forget. And I will definitely never forget the people I’ve met through Key Club. Even if I never see these amazing individuals again, the memories and bonds made will forever stick with me. So by the end of my last official day of Key Club, I’ll be cleaning up the carnival booths and picking up trash at the Williams Elementary School Carnival Volunteering and leaving this club that has forged something special on me one last time. But I’ll be at peace because I’ll look back at this journey and think, “wow.” The journey that you enter when you sign up for this club is unforgettable. So even if I never step into this journey again, the experience will always stay with me becuase service never sleeps, and Key Club Lyfe never ends.

            <h1>Eliminate Week</h1>
            <p>May 19, 2017</p>
            <hr>
            <div class="update1-inner">
                <p>Maternal Neonatal Tetanus. That is what we are fighting against. Every year Key Club International hosts an Eliminate Week- a week in which Key Clubbers from around the world raise awareness and funds for the Eliminate Project. For those of you who don't know about the Elimiante Project, it is a project dedicated towards eliminating maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNT)- a disease that affects women and newborns around the world. Just $1.80 can save a mother and her child from the effects. With just 18 countries affected left, Key Club International and UNICEF are more determined than ever to work together to fulfill their pledges to eliminate this disease. This past week was filled with fun spirit days that reminded me and many others why the Eliminate Project is so important. </p>
                <p> MONDAY : Mommy Monday. It was time to bring a stuffed animal to school! This was the day that probably raised the most awareness for the Eliminate Project. As I walked around the hall with my moose stuffed animal that I like to  call Moosey, everyone always petted and commented on it. The most common thing I heard was, "It's such a strange and random day to bring a stuffed animal to school, but I guess it's Tiana so..." At least I could raise awareness by telling them the reason for being weird and more about the Eliminate Project! </p>
                <p> TUESDAY : Cue The Blue. Cue the Blue Tuesday meant that it was time to look through my closet and bleed blue! This spirit day felt like a class color day, so it was fun seeing so many people participate. Although we aren't allowed to wear all blue at school, there were too many people breaking the dress code for a good cause, that nobody got in trouble- although people did look at us weirly again. </p>
                <p> WEDNESDAY : Eliminate Backdrop. This is where I got the background photo from! After the Key Club Meeting on Wednesday, there was an ELiminate themed backdrop set up outside that all the members took photos with and posted on social media to complete the challenge. It was a fun way to inform others about the Eliminate Project and bond after the meeting at the same time, becuase who doesn't like backdrops! </p>
                <p> THURSDAY : Throw Back Thursday. In order to get spirited for this day, we had to post a baby picture of myself on social media and inform everyone of the Eliminate Project in my caption. It was so nice to look through my baby pictures again. I teamed up with my friend to have matching photos to put on Instagram, so it took a little longer to find the perfect baby picture, but it was worth the time. </p>
                <p> FRIDAY : Elemonade. For Elemonade Friday, we were challenged to ake lemonade for our mom and take a picture.This was probably the hardest day because I'm not really good at doing anything in the kitchen. So, I asked my friend to help me out with this one. After getting all of the materials and making the lemonade, we tried it and it actually tasted very bad. Since, my mom was coming home soon, we decided to use the powder that we had instead to make the process go by faster. Nobody can be perfect, I guess.</p>
                <p>Sadly, this was my last Eliminate Week I would participate in with my home club. However, that doesn't stop me from continuing to help spread awareness and donate to the Eliminate Project. I'm so glad I've been introduced to an amazing cause. I hope that the remaining 18 countries get eliminated soon.</p>
