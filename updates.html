                <p>Recently I came across the question of why pigeons move their heads back and forth while they walkk and discovered that pigeons do so in order stabilize their vision and gain depth perception.Interestingly enough, after further reading, I found out that pigeons actually don't bob their heads back and forth, but rather they move their heads forward and then keep it still until their body catches up. What an illusion.</p>
                <p>As I ended my first quarter of Santa Clara University, I realized how much I didn't know. Although, I'm thankful that I've met so many individuals whom have already taught me so much about their own cultures and other common information about life in general, there is always an itch in the back of my mind reminding me that I can always learn more. Even simply coming across the question regarding the movement of pigeons is something interesting to add to my knowledge. Through learning more things everyday — whether or not it is useful information — I add to my knowledge and can further add to conversations and teach other individuals. That's why, as I move forward to the next year, I plan to embark on a new journey : Project Explore. And no, this isn't exploring the area, but exploring the mind. It's about exploring the information that I never knew before. It's about thinking beyond what I am asked. It's about asking questions and challenging ideas. It's about exploring what I don't and do know to further understand other individuals and the world. I'm ready to move forward.</p>

                <p>The start of my first year at Santa Clara University means the start of something new! I wanted to make something that I could look back upon at the end of the year and think, "Wow life at SCU was really fun." The first idea that came to my mind was to keep a journal. However, I knew that I would get caught up in school that I may not have been able to write much every day or just not write at all. As a result, I decided to make a Bullet Journal. For those of you who may not know, a Bullet Journal is a journal that consists of to-do lists, personal entries, event trackers, and much more. Once I got this idea, I decided to get started with the September portion right away.</p>
                <p>"Look at the sky," my friend once told me. For a while I was confused, for I didn't see anything in the sky; it was just blue. But I finally figured it out and responded, "Because the sky is limitless." It turns out that there was no right answer, but I had been the first person with a positive response. This moment ran through my head as I was trying to pick the Bullet Journal September theme and as a result, I decided to have a sky theme because the first year will be limitless. Filling the pages with decorative clouds, suns, and paper airplanes, I was so exscited for it to finally be September so that I could fill this journal out. Aside from the decorative drawings, I decided to also add a calendar to add events to, a habit tracker to track how many times I do certain positive habits, a sleep tracker to log the hours I sleep every day, a class schedule to remind myself of my first quarter, a daily to-do list to remind myself of what I have to do every day, and an all things new list to log all of the new things I do and see at SCU. Ultimately through this Bullet Journal, I hope to encourage myself to do better things every day and look back at the year thinking it was the best year yet.</p>

                <p>iD Tech was definitely an amazing experience and I'm so glad I got to end my iD Tech experience at Stanford University iD Tech Alexa. At this camp, all of the students were girls and many of them stayed overnight at Stanford with the instructors. In addition to that, the set up at Alexa was definitely different from iD Tech Camps as well. This made teaching the students a completely different experience that added a lot of variety. Another difference was that after hours of teaching, we ended our instructional time with a group chat about certain questions we prepared for them to help the students think more about what inspires them. By the end of the week, I made sure that the students' final project helped solve a social issue that was important to them. After instructional time, we prepared activities for the overnight campers to keep them entertained, such as a Scavenger Hunt and Movie Night. This was the time in which I could learn a lot from the students. From learning how to make friendship bracelets for the first time, to being informed about current celebrity gossip, I definitely enjoyed my time with them throughout the entire week. I even got the opportunity to wake the students up at 6:50AM almost every morning. I was so excited to do this that I made sure I knocked on their dorm doors right on time and even have a small conversation with each of them.</p>
                <p>Though iD Tech Camp at West Valley College was not an overnight experience, I still had a fun time teaching the students and, once again, learning a lot from them. During our breaks away from the computers, the students taught me things like magic tricks with cards -that I now try to show my friends- and various video games like narwhale.io. By the end of the session at West Valley College, it was time to pack everything up and say our final goodbyes. It was a long process that was bittersweet. As much as I wanted to go home and sleep after the tiring day, I wanted to stay because it couldn't hit me that this may be the last time I see some of my co-workers again. After we finished packing up, we gathered for one final staff raffle and a group hug. </p>
                <p>Aside from the students, my co-workers were also amazing people and I got to learn a lot from the workers from both West Valley College  iD Tech Camp and Stanford university iD Tech Alexa. At both locations, all of my co-workers had already finished at least a year in college, which made the experience very intereseting. As some of them taught me different things that happen in college and what to stay away from, others simply taught me random facts that they learned in college. By the end of every day, I would have a new perspective on at least one thing. I'm glad I got to come out of iD Tech with more knowledge than I had before. It was definitely an experience I will never forget.</p>

                  <p>The moment my alarm clock goes off, I can only think, “Not again.” I begin slicking my hair back into a ponytail, while frantically looking through my closet for a leotard. I’m running out of time. “Let’s go,” I shout. This has been my Saturday routine since I was four years old.</p>
                  <p>Never had I ever thought that a performing art would create a big impact on my life and allow me to learn life lessons that I would hold onto forever. Through dance, I’ve been given the wonderful opportunity to meet so many people with different backgrounds and perspectives on life. When I walk into dance class, I enter a new world, surrounded by people with different backgrounds. To my right, I find a girl struggling with anxiety while to my left, I find a boy living the ideal life. From Big Tiana screaming at Alyssa to say “grandma” in Vietnamese, to the current team wanting to play SAT games on my phone, I have definitely met a diverse group of individuals. However, regardless of the differences each dancer holds, we gather for one motive : to perform our passion. We learn from each other’s strengths and weaknesses so that we can congruously move to the rhythm together. But I couldn’t have gotten to this point or be who I am without the special individual who has taught me so many things over the years.</p>
                 <p> Not only did I learn a variety of tricks, jumps, and turns, but I also learned important life lessons that I now hold and integrate into my way of life. It’s amazing how much the things you do and say have rubbed off on me because I definitely do tell my students that “not everyone is a winner” at iD Tech. I definitely did tell my Key Club Board that just because we got all the awards in the Division doesn’t mean we’re good, it just means that “everyone else is a lot worse.” And of course, I definitely do listen to Ed Sheeran all of time in the car. Your lessons have a big impact on my life and I couldn’t be where I am or who I am without you. I can’t believe that after 14 years I am finally going off to college and sadly writing this letter. But it’s good to know that even if I never step into this dance journey again, the values and lessons learned will forever stay with me. Luckily, I'll be staying close for college, so I can come back and visit any time. See you soon, De Lynn Dance Company.</p>

                <p>Santa Clara University's Orientation was not what I thought it would be. The moment I stepped out of my car, there was already a welcoming Orientation Leader dancing around, ready to lead me to the Residence Halls. "FULL SEND. IT'S A FULL SEND," echoed throughout the school. After I checked into my room, I observed my surroundings, because I was clueless of what to do next. A lot of individuals were on their phone- whether they were actually  using it or just to pass by awkward time. Instead of using my phone, I decided to start a conversation with some people. Everyone that I met throughout the day at every Oreintation Session I attended were all kind and welcoming. From talking about the college life, to talking about our favorite Disney movie, I had a wide variety of conversations with many people. </p>
                <p>At the end of the day, we had a big social that the Orientation Leaders made a big deal out of. They all were running up and down with microphones and were dressed up in safari themed outfits. As they screamed Bronco Chants and led us to the social room, everyone around me was excited and ready to have some fun for the night. Once we all got to the room, they taught us the SCU Cheer and performed a long and intricate dance for us. This was probably the most awkward part for my at Orientation becuase I'm an extremely awkward dancer. So instead of dancing the night, I went back to the residance halls to play board games and watch movies withmy peers.The next morning, I finally got to choose my classes and plan the rest of the year with a counselour. Though it was a little stressing, I really liked looking at the great variety of classes and freedom to choose whichever one I wanted. We finally ended Orientation inside the theater and met up with our RLC group to do our final group "Unity" cheer. I really enjoyed having this session as the closing welcoming session to SCU. </p>
                <p>Thank you for making it an amazing two days for me. It was definitely a great experience that showed me that this school will always be there for me when I need it with amazing individuals who will help guide me to great education and future as well as individuals who know how to make me smile. I can't wait to "full send it" at Santa Clara University in September.</p>

        <h1>Back Into The Club</h1>
        <p>June 24, 2017</p>
        <hr>
        <div class="update1-inner">
            <p>Less than a month later and I'm already back at it again with Key Club. After being asked by the Division 12 South Lieutenant Governor to host two workshops(the "Presidents Workshop" "and the "BEEing a Leader Workshop") at Key Club Training Conference, I couldn't just let this opportunity go. I wanted to make sure that the future leaders of Key Club would be trained and ready to leave a legacy. I was truly excited to share my love for Key Club and Key Club knowledge to all the future and current leaders.</p>
            <p>In the midst of teaching at iD Tech, I was preparing to lead workshops with my partners: the President of Silver Creek Key Club and the Division 34 South Lieutenant Governor. I wasn't really sure what to expect, since this would be my first time at Key CLub Training Conference, but my partners were cooperative and on top of their game. By the time Key Club Training Conference came, there were so many familiar faces that I got to reunite and catch up with. Not only did I get to catch up with the Key Clubbers, but I also got to talk to all of the amazing advisors and Kiwanians who made this event happen again. In between each Round Robbin Workshop for BEEing a Leader, I got to ask Key Clubbers questions about Key Club to test their knowledge and get to know them. Although some did not know the answer, they were all determined to try again with a different question. However, many of them were spot on with their answers, which made the event so great and fun. </p>
            <p>Though attending Key Club Training Conference was a wonderful experience, it honestly felt a little odd coming back into the club and attending a Region event in the Summer. I felt as if I didn't belong there anymore- as if my time in Key Club was over. Although, yes it's true, my time in Key Club is over, I couldn't help but letting that get to me and reminding myself about that throughout the entire event. In fact, one of my very own club members asked me if I was here to chaperone for them. That is when it hit me that I needed to stop living in the past and look towards the future. Yes, I'll still visit Leland Key Club occassionally to check up on them and reunite with people I've formed a great relationship with through this club, but I'll always remember that it's about the new leaders of Key Club leaving a legacy. So thank you again Key Club for everything. See you soon. </p>

                <p>I had aboslutely no clue what the iD Tech Life would be like, but I'm so glad I am being a part of it. Prior to working with iD Tech, I was having a conversation with my friend's mom about tech companies and iD Tech popped up into our conversation. "I was going to send my son to iD Tech, but then I read a bad review, so I decided to not send him to that camp anymore," she mentioned. Now, I never told her that I had applied to work there, and after she made her comments about iD Tech, I was scared to tell her. After I got a job offer from them and accepted it, I made it my duty to give the kids a fun, safe, and great learning experience that would bring them back next summer. I imdediately started making worksheets for my courses and planning out daily agendas. I couldn't be a disappointment. </p>
                <img src="/img/idtech2.jpg" width="300" height="250"  style="float:left" >
                <p>Just yesterday, I finished off my first week of working with iD Tech, and boy was it scary yet exciting. This first course that I had to teach was called Coding 101. In this course, I taught the students JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. While I love working with children, it was definitely difficult to get them to pay close attention and fully understand what is happening behind their code. At the end of every day, they always had more questions, making me stay up late to create worksheets filled with answers and practice exercises so that they could further understand the program. Teaching the kids was a little tough, but I was so happy that by the end of the week, they had made a clean and aesthetic website filled with many interactive features and skills I taught them. </p>
                <p>Teaching wasn't all of what I had to keep in mind during camp. I had to make sure that everyone was having fun, yet being safe at the same time. From planning spirit days for the campers to enjoy, to planning fun activiites for the kids to play during the breaks off the computers, I tried my best to make their camp experience special. This being my first week working at iD Tech and West Valley's first iD Tech Camp ever, I was determined to ensure that it went smoothly. </p>
                <p>There is no doubt that there were some obstacles we all had to tackle throughout the week, it only made me stronger. Through this first week, I've not only gained skills in teaching and handling kids, but also learned new iDeas and perspectives from my coworkers. I'm excited to spend the rest of my summer working with iD Tech and gaining new iDeas. </p>

            <h1>Goodbye Leland High School</h1>
            <p>June 8, 2017</p>

            <div class="update1-inner">
                <div class="column">
                    <p>I'm the kind of person who doesn't mind a lot of things and just goes with the flow. When I'm asked to make a decision, I tend to say, "Anything you want is fine by me," until they force me to pick something. This is both a good and a bad trait that I've noticed as many things end and I have to say goodbye. Don't get me wrong, I do have some emotion when things are ending, but not enough for me to completely throw my life away and think about it for a long time. Today was graduation. I've never had such a bad high school experience to the point in which I want to leave so badly, but at the same time I don't mind leaving and starting something new. On the the other hand, I haven't had such an amazing high school experience to the point in which I want to stay so badly, but at the same time I wouldn't mind spending another year at Leland.</p>
                    <p> Though I do have my weird trait, I still thought that graduation would be emotional and the fact that I'm leaving would really hit me as I walked across the stage. However, while many of my other friends were crying and hugging one another and taking pictures while saying their final goodbyes, I realized that I was not emotional at all. In fact, I don't think I really felt anything, besides my stomach growling for food and a rush to finish taking pictures with everyone who came to support me. Even after I finsihed taking pictures with my relatives and close friends, I just stood there - looking around to see what I should do next. My brother suggested that I walk around and see if I wanted to take pictures with anyone else, so I did. After half a round of the Rose Garden, I had only found one other person to take a picture with, but I was satisfied. My brother asked me again to walk around because it was the last time I would ever see many of these individuals again, but I resisted. What really mattered was that I got pictures with the people who were close to me and impacted my high school career greatly. And that was enough. Thank you to everyone who I encountered throuhgout my journey through high school. And goodbye Leland High School.</p>

                <p>The end of Key Club means the end of many things. It means the end of my Key Club duties. It means the end of Division Council Meetings. It means the end of volunteering with the most passionate people at Leland High School. But it also means the end of the Instagram highonkey account that I made with my secretary and best friend, Jessica. After a meeting in January, we realized that our Key Club Journey was ending soon. As a result, we decided to be a little extra and make an account that would document something Key Club related that we did everyday until today- the end. Before I talk about the account, I'll share my Key Club Journey with you to show you why I would even love a club so much to do this.</p>
                <p>It's a little embarrassing to say that my Key Club Journey started off with my brother forcing me to join Key Club when he was President and I was a freshman. Being a shy and timid person, I forced the rest of my friends along with me so that I would have someone to be with in the club. Now it’s even more embarrassing to say I never had a real passion for Key Club until about four months after I became Project Coordinator my Freshman Year. I had always thought that I really liked Key Club until that time, but later on I realized that it was a fake love formed just because my brother was passionate about it. In my mind, I imagined that the more work I did for Key Club, the more passionate I would be. As a result, I always tried to coordinate the most events in one month and do as much extra work as I could possibly do. The new passion formed four months after wasn’t developed until I realized that it’s better to find quality service projects that more members would be excited to come to and focus on tackling a specific aspect to improve Key Club before moving on to the next problem. As time went on, I continued to take these baby steps until I could finally take risks in the different ways I ran things. And finally by the end of my Sophomore year, I got the courage to pursue the position of President of Leland Key Club. </p>
                <p>From then on, it became a long, windy, up and down roller coaster that I never wanted to end. But here we are. There is no doubt that there were plenty of mistakes made throughout my Key CLub Journey, but if I had the opportunity to change something, I wouldn’t change a thing because every ounce of effort and action that occurred led up to this year, to now, to the end of an amazing ride I could never forget. Seeing so many members constantly signing up for events and attending fundraisers and socials made me feel proud to be part of Leland Key Club. I have been given the wonderful opportunity to meet many spectacular individuals who not only exemplify the Key Club core values, but integrate them into their way of life as well. It’s the best feeling when a Key Clubbers comes up to you and tells you how fun an event was because then, you know that you are doing your job right. Though Key Club is full of wonderful individuals, not everything is perfect. With every problem and conflict came a rewarding lesson to learn from the experience. I have definitely grown as an individual, learning the biggest lessons in my high school career through Key Club. So, thank you Key Club for expanding my horizons and shaping me into a better leader and person. Thank you key Club for making me realize that the most popular decision may not always be the right decision. Thank you key club for showing me that it’s okay to be my weird self without caring what everyone has to think of me. But most importantly, thank you Key Club for giving me a second family I can share my life stories with and depend upon when I’m down. </p>
                <p>So there you have it, a quick summary of why I enjoy this club so much. However, highonkey wasn't made just for us, it was made for everyone. We wanted to rub our passion for Key Club off on others who were following our account and remind them everyday of why Key Club is so special. We especially hope to see more highonkey accounts in the future because it's such a wonderful organization. It’s amazing how so many people join Key Club for the college applications, scholarships, or maybe because they were forced into it like I was, but they all stay for the same reason : to become part of a family they can never forget. And I will definitely never forget the people I’ve met through Key Club. Even if I never see these amazing individuals again, the memories and bonds made will forever stick with me. So by the end of my last official day of Key Club, I’ll be cleaning up the carnival booths and picking up trash at the Williams Elementary School Carnival Volunteering and leaving this club that has forged something special on me one last time. But I’ll be at peace because I’ll look back at this journey and think, “wow.” The journey that you enter when you sign up for this club is unforgettable. So even if I never step into this journey again, the experience will always stay with me becuase service never sleeps, and Key Club Lyfe never ends.

                <p>Maternal Neonatal Tetanus. That is what we are fighting against. Every year Key Club International hosts an Eliminate Week- a week in which Key Clubbers from around the world raise awareness and funds for the Eliminate Project. For those of you who don't know about the Elimiante Project, it is a project dedicated towards eliminating maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNT)- a disease that affects women and newborns around the world. Just $1.80 can save a mother and her child from the effects. With just 18 countries affected left, Key Club International and UNICEF are more determined than ever to work together to fulfill their pledges to eliminate this disease. This past week was filled with fun spirit days that reminded me and many others why the Eliminate Project is so important. </p>
                <p> MONDAY : Mommy Monday. It was time to bring a stuffed animal to school! This was the day that probably raised the most awareness for the Eliminate Project. As I walked around the hall with my moose stuffed animal that I like to  call Moosey, everyone always petted and commented on it. The most common thing I heard was, "It's such a strange and random day to bring a stuffed animal to school, but I guess it's Tiana so..." At least I could raise awareness by telling them the reason for being weird and more about the Eliminate Project! </p>
                <p> TUESDAY : Cue The Blue. Cue the Blue Tuesday meant that it was time to look through my closet and bleed blue! This spirit day felt like a class color day, so it was fun seeing so many people participate. Although we aren't allowed to wear all blue at school, there were too many people breaking the dress code for a good cause, that nobody got in trouble- although people did look at us weirly again. </p>
                <p> WEDNESDAY : Eliminate Backdrop. This is where I got the background photo from! After the Key Club Meeting on Wednesday, there was an ELiminate themed backdrop set up outside that all the members took photos with and posted on social media to complete the challenge. It was a fun way to inform others about the Eliminate Project and bond after the meeting at the same time, becuase who doesn't like backdrops! </p>
                <p> THURSDAY : Throw Back Thursday. In order to get spirited for this day, we had to post a baby picture of myself on social media and inform everyone of the Eliminate Project in my caption. It was so nice to look through my baby pictures again. I teamed up with my friend to have matching photos to put on Instagram, so it took a little longer to find the perfect baby picture, but it was worth the time. </p>
                <p> FRIDAY : Elemonade. For Elemonade Friday, we were challenged to ake lemonade for our mom and take a picture.This was probably the hardest day because I'm not really good at doing anything in the kitchen. So, I asked my friend to help me out with this one. After getting all of the materials and making the lemonade, we tried it and it actually tasted very bad. Since, my mom was coming home soon, we decided to use the powder that we had instead to make the process go by faster. Nobody can be perfect, I guess.</p>
                <p>Sadly, this was my last Eliminate Week I would participate in with my home club. However, that doesn't stop me from continuing to help spread awareness and donate to the Eliminate Project. I'm so glad I've been introduced to an amazing cause. I hope that the remaining 18 countries get eliminated soon.</p>
