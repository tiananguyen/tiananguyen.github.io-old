                    <h4 class= "abouttext">Hello, my name is Tiana Nguyen and I'm a rising Sophomore at Santa Clara University studying Computer Science. Throughout the years, I have tried many different activities, but only a few really grew on me. Below is a glimpse of what I like to do during my daily life. All of the activities have definitely impacted me and taught me many lessons along the way. </h4>

            <h3> Dance </h3>
            <br>
            <p> Dance has been a part of my life since I was 4 years old. Not only have I been able to learn jumps and turns through acrobatics, tap, jazz, and tap, but I've also learned life lessons along the way. Through dance, I’ve been given the wonderful opportunity to meet so many people with different backgrounds and perspectives on life. However, regardless of the differences each dancer holds, we gather for one motive : to perform our passion. We learn from each other’s strengths and weaknesses so that we can congruously move to the rhythm together. </p>

            <h3> Volunteering </h3>
            <br>
            <p>I always liked helping other people and ever since I joined Key Club in high school I have loved giving back to the community in any way I can. As a the Project Coordinator and then President of the club, I organized a wide scope of projects which ranged from making bikes and cards for kids to crafting blankets for abused children.Because of these experiences, much of what I do today is with a larger goal to give back to the community, especially with my degree. I can't wait to see where my affinity for programming and giving back will take me.</p>

            <h3> Crafting </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Crafting has always been soemthing that I loved since I was a little girl. At the young age, I would finger croche mittens and scarfs for my family for birthday gifts as well as use various medias to paint on canvas. During High School, I began to make assecories for people to wear for spirit days and rallies. From hot gluing together flower crowns late at night, to stringing together leis for graduations and member recognition, I have found a strong passion for crafting. I especially enjoy using my love for crafting to make gifts for others to enjoy!</p>

            <h3> Graphic Design </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Graphic Design quickly became my passion after I assisted my Bulletin Editor in Leland Key Club to make a newsletter. After this experience, I started to design other flyers for the club. In my spare time, I even create some templates for flyers in case I would need to use it in the future. Through this, I was able to grab the attention of and inform members about upcoming events, past events, preferred charities, and more. </p>

            <h3> Photography</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Though I'm not the best photographer, I like to play around with my camera and bring it to the adventures I go on to capture memories. Through photography, I have grown closer to other people who have different perspectives and I've learned from their point of view in life. Photography has also helped me capture moments in life that I can look back at. I'm always looking for an excuse to use my camera!</p>

            <h3>Hiking</h3>
            <br>
            <p>After staring at the computer screen all day, I like to take a break outside and go for a  hike. Near the end of my high school career, I've learned that I  often take the beauty of nature for granted. As a result, I began to hike and pay close observations to the little things around me and I've been doing it ever since. I constantly try to go outside as much as possible, and hiking is one of my favorite pass times while I'm outside.</p>
